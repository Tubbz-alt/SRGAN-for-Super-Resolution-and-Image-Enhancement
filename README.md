# Deep-Learning-for-Super-Resolution-and-Image-Enhancement
Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) is a deep learning application to generate high resolution (HR) images from low resolution (LR) image. In this work, we use SRGAN to up-scale 32x32 images to 128x128 pixels. Meanwhile, we evaluate the impact of different camera parameters on the quality of final up-scaled (high resolution) images and infer from these stimuli to understand what the network is able to learn.
